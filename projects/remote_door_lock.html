                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
                    This part is not terribly technical or interesting, so I'll be brief.
                    Bottom line: depending on the material of the door, the shape of the thumbturn, etc.,
                    retrofitting a unit like this might impossible in the first place.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
                    In my particular case, the wall(?) of the cylindrical base of the thumbturn was <strong>perpendicular</strong> to the door, and this made retrofitting possible.
                    If that part was tapered (i.e. shaped like a circular truncated cone), this whole project would not have happened.
                    That is all I need to say.

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">Setting up hardware and software</h2>

                <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">1. Set up an internet facing proxy server</h4>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
                    <li>As my ISP implements CG-NAT, there is no way to directly access the Raspbrry Pi in my room over the internet.</li>
                    <li>So I span up a small instance on a cloud service provider and set up a reverse proxy on it.
                        A smallest & the most affordable instance in any cloud service should be sufficient for this task.
                        This instance is set up to be internet-facing so I can access it from my phone when I'm away from home. I'll simply call it VPS for the rest of this article.</li>
                    <li>The IP address of the VPS is mapped to a domain that I own. This way, I can send http request over HTTPS; this is critical to secure lock/unlock requests. More on this later.</li>
                    <li>All of this means that this DIY lock incurs what is effectively a "subscription fee" in 2 ways:</li>
                    <ol class="list-decimal pl-8 mt-2 space-y-1">
                        <li>VPS (approx. $30 / year)</li>
                        <li>Domain renewal fee (approx. $16 / year)</li>
                    </ol>
                    so this cost exceeds the limit that I stated in the constraints section and $46 / year price tag does not feel cheap... Then again, both the VPS and the domain can be used for other purposes.
                </ul>

                <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">2. Set up the Raspberry Pi</h4>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
                    <li>First I set up a raspberry pi with a very standard configuration (Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit with SSH server enabled + pigpio & gpiozero libraries)</li>
                    <li>Then set up an SSH tunnel on the Raspberry Pi to the VPS. This way, the https request that I send from my phone to the VPS can be proxied to the pi.</li>
                    <li>Pi runs a simple web server and receives the http requests proxied from the VPS. It processes the requests to control the lock.</li>
                    <li>Pi controls 2 hardware devices via GPIO pins, a servo motor and a relay hat, to lock and unlock the lock.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">3. Send lock/unlock request over https</h4>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
                    <li>The door is locked/unlocked via an http POST request sent from the user's mobile device (i.e. phone). There are currently 2 ways to send the http request from the phone.
                        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
                            <li><strong>A user friendly way (primary):</strong> an Android app that I built for this project. The app has a simple UI consisting of 2 buttons: 'Lock' and 'Unlock'. All this app does is basically to send 2 kinds of https POST requests (for locking and unlocking the door) with the tap of the lock/unlock button, respectively. This is a very simple app, so the maintenance cost of this app should remain low for the foreseable future.</li>
                            <li><strong>A backup (plan B):</strong> the curl command from the terminal emulator app on Android (Termux)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>As a simple security measure, key (a string) is set to the request body and sent with the request. Pi verifies the key and if it determines that the key is correct, it performs lock/unlock operation, as described in the next section. Note that this is why https is nonnegotiable, which makes keeping the domain and paying for the renwals nonnegotiable as well.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>The user sends an https request to the VPS.</li>
                    <li>The request is proxied to the Raspberry Pi in my room.</li>
                    <li>The web server on the pi
                        <ol class="list-decimal pl-8 mt-2 space-y-1">
                            <li>Switches on the relay (power is supplied to the servo motor).</li>
                            <li>Turns the servo arm by 90 degrees (this locks/unlocks the key).</li>
                            <li>Turns the servo arm by 90 degrees in the opposite direction.</li>
                            <li>Switches off the relay (stops the supply of power to the servo motor).</li>
                        </ol>

                <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">Why bother switching on/off the relay every time the door is locked/unlocked</h4>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
                    <li>So the problem was this: when the servo motor is connected to the power, it holds the position of the arm with its torque and this would get in the way if I try to lock/unlok the door using my key; the servo I chose is relatively small but it is powerful enough to block the turning of the thumbturn with the key. The easiest way to get around this issue is to ensure that the servo motor is connected to the power only when it's used to turn the thumbturn.</li>
                    <li>To be honest, I know very little about servo motor and I'm sure that there is a better way, but this was the best I came up with.</li>
                    <li>But being able to lock/unlock using the physical key, should the system stops working, is a mandatory feature; in theory, it would not be necessary if this DIY remote door lock works perfectly. But in practice, it will malfunction at some point in some way (it has), and the last thing I want is getting locked out.</li>

                <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">July 2022 - replacing the servo motor</h4>

                        After a couple of months of use, the servo motor started failing; it stopped turning in one continuous motion. Instead, it wiggles and falters halfway through its 90-degree turning motion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First I tested the servo motor without the load (i.e. no pushing of the thumb turn), but I got the same result. Then I tested it with another pi I have without the load; again, the same problem persisted. So I concluded that the servo motor did indeed break.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I bought the exact same model of servo motor and replaced the old one. Then everything was back to normal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'd estimate that the servo went through a couple hundred to several hundred times of 90-degree turns before starting to suffer the aforementioned problem, which does not sound impressive even for a cheap commodity servo motor. Was it just a bad luck or was the load too heavy? I do not know. But as I replaced it with the exact same model, I'll keep an eye on it and I'll see what will happen after roughly the same amount of time passes.
